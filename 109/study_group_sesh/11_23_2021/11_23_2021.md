A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward. Examples of numerical palindromes are:

2332 
110011 
54322345

You'll be given 2 numbers as arguments: (num, s). Write a method which returns an array of s number of numerical palindromes that come after num. If num is a palindrome itself, it should be included in the count. 

Return "Not valid" instead if any one of the inputs is not an integer or is less than 0.

# PROBLEM
Objective: Given 2 numbers (num, s), find s number of palindromes that are greater than num, and return in an array

Input: 2 numbers
  - first argument will be our starting number
  - second argument will be the number of palindromes to find

Return Value: array containing palindromes

Rules:
- numbers in the returned array will be palindromes
- numbers in the returned array will be greater than equal to starting number that we're given
- If first argument is a palindrome itself, it should be included in the count.
- inputs need to be 0 or a positive integer
  - return "Not valid" if otherwise
- definition of a palindrome: reads the same forward and backward
- single-digit numbers are not considered palindromes
- if second argument is 0, return an empty array
- return a one-dimensional array
- sequence of palindromes in the returned array will be the next greatest palindrome available in ascending order
- data type of numbers in the returned array will be integers
  
Questions:
- if the number is only one digit, is it considered a palindrome?
- sequence of palindromes in the returned array?
- what if the second argument is 0?
- what data type do the "numbers" in the returned array need to be?
- what organization will the returned array? Do we need to worry about nesting?


# EXAMPLES
p palindrome(6,4) == [11,22,33,44]
p palindrome(75,1) == [77]
p palindrome(101,2) == [101,111]
p palindrome(20,0) == []
p palindrome(0,4) == [11,22,33,44]
p palindrome("ACCDDCCA",3) == "Not valid"
p palindrome(773,"1551") == "Not valid"
p palindrome(-4505,15) == "Not valid"
p palindrome(4505,-15) == "Not valid"


# DATA STRUCTURES
- Input: 2 integers - 0 or greater
- Output/Return Value: array containing positive integers
  - return a string "Not valid" if arguments aren't valid
- Intermediate: array

# ALGORITHM

Alex:
-test if inputs are valid (>0 and integers)
-    if not valid, return "Not valid"
-initialize arr = empty array
-test if num is a palindrome and >= 10
-    turn to string, reverse and see if it is the same as given (for palindrom test)
-    if true, push to array
-    if false, skip this step
-create counter variable = 1
- loop
-    break loop if arr size == second argument given
-    new_num = num + 1
-    test if num is a palindrome && greateer than 10
-      if true, add to array
-      if false, run through loop again

Annie:

1. take in two integers, num and s 
2. if num or s is not a positive integer, return not valid
3. initialize an empty array
4. starting at num, count up and if a number is a palindrome (if num.to_s.reverse == num.to_s), append it to the end of the array
5. once the length of the array is equal to s, stop and return the array

Ethan:

Given a starting integer _num_ and an integer _s_
- If `num` is invalid, return "Not valid"
- Otherwise:
  - Initialize an empty `palindromes` array
  - Initialize a `counter` to num
  - Loop
    - Append `num` to array if `num` is a palindrome
    - Increment `num` by 1
    - Break once the size of the array is `s`
  - Return the `palindromes array`

*Sub-Problems*

# Determine whether a number is valid

Given a _number_
- Return true if:
  - The number is an integer AND
  - The number is at least zero

# Determine whether a number is a palindrome

Given a _number_:
- Convert the number to a `string`
- Return true if:
  - The length of the string is at least 2 AND
  - The `string` is equal to itself reversed
- Otherwise, return false

# ALGORITHM

- Method passes in two arguments (num, s)
- Check both arguments for validity (integers 0 or greater)
  - If either is invalid, return "Not valid"
- Create empty array to hold number palindromes
- Check s to see if it is equal to 0
  - If so, return array as is 
- Create counter variable and set to 0

- Begin looping sequence
  - Convert num to string for conditional checking 
    - If length of string == 2, compare its equality to its reversed form
      - If palindrome, push to array
  - Increment num by 1
  - Break loop when counter == s
- End loop

- Return array



Ryan D:
ALGORITHM

- one problem - detrmine if a number is a palindrome - helper method
  - convert the int to a str
  - check to see if the string is the same as it is reversed
  - return boolean

- second problem - find next palindrome - helper method
  - given a number - this will serve as a counter in the helper method for the loop
  - start a loop
  - check if it is palindrome with helper method
  - break if is_palindrome? is true
  - increment the number
  - return that value of the number when loops breaks - that's the next palindrome

- main problem method
  - handle invalid inputs and return "not valid"
  - set an empty results array - this will store results and be returned
  - set a current num variable = to intial number passed
  - start a loop
  - while the size of results is less than s (target size of results array)
  - send into the results array the return value of the helper method find_next_palindrome called with current num variable
    - this method is set up like a do/while, if the initial number is a palindrome it will be sent
    - increment current num variable so it is called
  - loop will break when array is appropriate size
  - return results array
  

- check if arguments are valid
- check from first argument up to an undetermined number whether current number is a palindrome
- if it is, store it in an array
- stop checking once number of palindromes we've found is equivalent to second argument


`palindrome` method:
- accept two arguments (the first representing the starting number, and second representing the number of palindromes to find)
- check if both arguments are valid (using `valid?` helper method)
  - if not, return "Not valid"
- create an empty results array to store resulting palindromes
- perform the follow actions until the size of the results array is equal to the second argument:
  - check if current number (start with first argument) is a palindrome (using `palindrome?` helper method)
    - if it is, append number to the results array
  - increment current number by 1 on each iteration
- return results array

`palindrome?` helper method - determine if argument is palindrome:
- accept integer as argument
- convert integer to string
- check if:
  - reverse of the string is equivalent to value of the string
  - the length of the string is greater than 1
- if both conditions are true, then return `true`
- if not, return `false`

`valid?` helper method - determine if arguments are valid:
- accept two arguments (the same arguments passed to `palindrome`)
- check if:
  - first argument is an integer
  - second argument is an integer
  - first argument and second argument are both greater than or equal to 0
- if all conditions are true, then return `true`
- if not, return `false`
